## Project Overview 
This project aims to predict medical insurance costs based on various factors such as age, sex, BMI, smoking status, and region. The dataset is analyzed for insights, including data distribution and relationships among features. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is performed using visualization techniques like histograms and scatter plots. Data preprocessing includes handling categorical variables and missing values. The dataset is split into training and testing sets for model evaluation. A Linear Regression model is implemented to predict insurance costs. The model's accuracy is assessed using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error and R-squared score. Hyperparameter tuning is applied to optimize the model's performance. Results are visualized to compare predicted versus actual costs. The findings help understand key factors influencing insurance premiums.

## Final Conclusion  
The Medical Insurance Cost Prediction project successfully demonstrates how machine learning can be leveraged to estimate healthcare costs. The study reveals that age, BMI, and smoking status are the most influential factors affecting insurance charges. Smokers tend to have significantly higher insurance costs compared to non-smokers. The dataset's categorical features were effectively encoded to ensure proper model performance. The Linear Regression model provides a reasonable prediction accuracy, with errors analyzed through evaluation metrics. While the model performed well, slight variations in predictions indicate potential improvements through advanced techniques like Polynomial Regression or Random Forest Regressor. The visualization techniques used help in understanding cost distribution across different demographics. Feature importance analysis suggests that additional variables, such as pre-existing medical conditions, could enhance prediction accuracy. Overall, this project offers valuable insights into medical insurance pricing, aiding insurance companies in premium calculations and individuals in understanding cost determinants. Future work may involve deep learning models for enhanced predictive accuracy and model robustness.
